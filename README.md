## What is it?

MMD For Unity allows you to import MMD (MikuMikuDance) resources to the Unity 3D video game engine.  
The [original project](http://mmd-for-unity-proj.github.io/mmd-for-unity/) has been abandoned and has become unusable in the latest versions of this engine.

This Fork fixes the bugs that prevented MMD For Unity from being used in modern versions of Unity.
